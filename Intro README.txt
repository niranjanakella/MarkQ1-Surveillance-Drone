Hello, I am Akella Niranjan. 
This is my first drone project and the journey has been great. I have understook that building something with our own hands is a completely new thing compared to understanding its mechanism, because when we build it we understand that there are many complications to it and every robot has a different way of expressing it self.
And as the creators of such a scientic life form it is our duty to listen carefully.

The complete spec list of the drone is specified in the .excel sheet. 

Enjoy the documentation!!
